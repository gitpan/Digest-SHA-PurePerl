Revision history for Perl module Digest::SHA::PurePerl.

5.31  Mon Sep  5 00:52:42 MST 2005
	- added standard tests for pod and pod-coverage checking
	- inserted subtest to check for failure when using
		unrecognized SHA algorithm
	- consolidated code for SHA and HMAC-SHA functions
		-- removed 190 lines by building functions at runtime
	- harmonized _sharewind and _shaopen subs with C versions
		-- other minor code cleanups

5.30  Sat Aug 20 16:46:08 MST 2005
	- updated docs with recent NIST statement on SHA-1
		-- advises use of larger and stronger hash functions
			(i.e. SHA-224/256/384/512) for new developments

5.29  Sun Aug 14 04:48:34 MST 2005
	- updated docs with cautionary note about SHA-1

5.28  Wed Nov 10 15:33:20 MST 2004
	- provided more flexible formatting of SHA state files
		-- entries may now contain embedded whitespace
			for improved readability
	- minor code cleanups

5.27  Sun Oct 24 02:54:00 MST 2004
	- minor code cleanups
		-- reduces size of dump files for SHA-1/224/256

5.26  Thu Oct  7 14:52:00 MST 2004
	- streamlined distribution
		-- reduced NIST vector tests from 200 to 20
			-- former number was overkill
			-- distro now downloads and builds more quickly
	- rewrote SYNOPSIS sections in pod file
	- made additional tweaks to t/8-shasum.t for portability
	- cleaned up test scripts

5.25  Sun Sep 12 18:48:00 MST 2004
	- removed non-essential test script
		-- t/8-shasum.t causes problems on sparc64-linux
	- reverted to using eval "require $module" in shasum

5.24  Sun Sep 12 02:50:18 MST 2004
	- modified shasum to use barewords in "require" statements
		-- ref. perl.cpan.testers (157305)

5.23  Thu Sep  9 23:06:18 MST 2004
	- corrected bug in test script
		-- use blib when invoking perl as an external
			command in t/8-shasum.t

5.22  Tue Sep  7 19:12:40 MST 2004
	- minor changes to documentation

5.21  Mon Aug 23 04:02:00 MST 2004
	- improved test script for "shasum" (t/8-shasum.t)
		-- exercises check file option (-c)

5.20  Sun Aug 15 04:24:48 MST 2004
	- introduced "shasum" script
		-- mimics the usage and behavior of "md5sum"
		-- adds "-a" option to select SHA algorithm
		-- for help, just type "shasum -h"

5.10  Fri Aug  6 02:10:12 MST 2004
	- simplified module documentation
		-- made it consistent with Digest::SHA docs

0.06  Tue Aug  3 02:12:40 MST 2004
	- improved performance of SHA-384/512
		-- using inline eval'ed code instead of subroutines
		-- 5.7 x faster than Version 0.05
			-- on alpha-dec_osf, using Gisle's benchmark

0.05  Sun Aug  1 03:56:54 MST 2004
	- fixed HMAC-SHA-384/512 bug
		-- code was using hardwired blocksize of SHA-1/256
	- added test cases to check HMAC-SHA-384/512 behavior
		-- thanks to Adam Woodbury for vectors and script mods
	- corrected misspelling in docs
		-- apologies to Gisle Aas

0.04  Fri Jul  2 01:10:48 MST 2004
	- added support for SHA-384/512
		-- module now offers full functionality of Digest::SHA
		-- however, use of SHA-384/512 requires 64-bit integers
	- included a SIGNATURE file
		-- for stronger authentication of module contents
			-- ref. Module::Signature on CPAN

0.03  Fri Jun 25 00:06:54 MST 2004
	- portability fix
		-- dump files caused warnings on 64-bit platforms
		-- enhanced "dump-load.t" to check correct behavior
	- performance tweak for 64-bit machines
		-- eliminated upper-32-bit masking on left shifts
		-- instead, need to mask only in _digcpy and _shadump

0.02  Tue Jun 22 04:24:00 MST 2004
	- Increased speed of SHA transforms
		-- using optimization ideas from Digest::SHA package
		-- SHA-1       ~  20% faster
		-- SHA-224/256 ~ 120% faster

0.01  Thu Jun 17 00:04:00 MST 2004
	- Initial version, derived from Digest::SHA 5.01
		-- hand-translation from C to Perl

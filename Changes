Revision history for Perl module Digest::SHA::PurePerl.

5.50  Tue Dec 14 06:20:08 MST 2010
	- adopted convention that '-' always means STDIN
		-- actual filename '-' accessed as './-'
		-- accords with behavior of sha1sum/md5sum
	- corrected undefined subroutine oversight in shasum
		-- inadvertent migration of _bail() from PurePerl.pm

5.49  Sun Dec 12 07:22:04 MST 2010
	- modified Addfile to accept all POSIX filenames
		-- standard allows all characters except NUL and '/'
	- updated shasum to more closely mimic sha1sum/md5sum
		-- added "backslash processing" to handle newlines
			and backslashes in filenames
		-- now accepts all POSIX filenames via Addfile
		-- thanks to Sean Burke for identifying edge cases

5.48  Mon Jan  4 16:32:52 MST 2010
	- fixed "shasum -a0" option (ref. rt.cpan.org #53319)
		-- incorrectly accepted 0 as a valid algorithm
			-- thanks to Zefram for patch
	- updated URL for NIST test vectors
		-- ref. files t/nistbit.t, t/nistbyte.t
			-- thanks to Leon Brocard for patch

		-- padding must be done by user if interoperability
			with other software is required

		-- to mimic behavior of md5sum

5.37  Mon May  8 04:30:09 MST 2006

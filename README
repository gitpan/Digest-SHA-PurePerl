Digest::SHA::PurePerl version 0.05
==================================

The Digest::SHA::PurePerl module provides an easy way to compute
message digests using Perl.  It supports all algorithms of the NIST
Secure Hash Standard (i.e. SHA-1, 224, 256, 384, and 512).  The
module also includes functions to compute keyed-hashes using the
HMAC algorithm.

The module is written in pure Perl; a C compiler is not required
to build or use it.  However, the code is MUCH slower than the
functionally-equivalent Digest::SHA module.  Also, please note that
Digest::SHA::PurePerl supports the SHA-384/512 algorithms only if
your platform uses 64-bit integers.

Digest::SHA::PurePerl conforms to the naming conventions and styles
of the CPAN Digest module.  Several features have been added, such
as the ability to:

	- calculate digests for bit-oriented messages
	- store and retrieve intermediate SHA states

This module inherits from Digest::base if the latter is installed
on your platform.  If the base class is not present, Digest::SHA::PurePerl
still works; it simply uses its own local routines to supply the
missing functionality.

Please refer to the tests subdirectory (t/*.t) for an extensive
set of SHA vectors compiled from various sources.  Of particular
interest are the NIST vectors, which examine a large variety of
bit-strings and byte-strings.
